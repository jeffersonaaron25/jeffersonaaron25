## Hey, I'm Jeff! 👋

I build 🛠️ AI‑powered solutions for a living.

## What I'm exploring right now:
Experimenting with and innovating out-of-the-box GenAI solutions—anything that helps LLMs create real‑world impact.

## Tech I reach for:
Python · PyTorch · LangGraph · React · Next.js

## Stuff I’ve done:
- M.S. Computer Engineering – New York University (’24)
- Life...

## Away from the keyboard:
When I’m not staring at the logs I’m probably dancing or road‑tripping.
