Hello!

I am Jefferson Aaron. Nice to meet you!

I co-founded a start-up called IMMIGREAT.

On my GitHub, you can find some useful files I created and things I learnt the hard way while working on Immigreat projects. Hoping to save some trouble for you! :)

Oh, you can also find some of my personal projects here! 

Cheers :)
