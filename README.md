Hello! 👋

I am Jefferson Nelsson. Nice to meet you!

I am a dedicated and passionate developer with expertise in Cloud Architecture, specifically in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS). My proficiency extends to creating scalable and efficient Flask/FAST APIs in Python, which have been instrumental in delivering robust and responsive applications. In addition, I have a strong background in DevOps practices, including continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), containerization, and infrastructure as code (IaC). I'm actively experimenting with LLM integrations such as LangChain and improving my knowledge and understanding. I also have experience in front-end development with JavaScript frameworks such as React JS and React-Native, as well as Android and iOS app deployment. I thrive in collaborative environments and am committed to delivering high-quality solutions that drive innovation and improve user experiences.

🧑‍🎓 Recently, I graduated with a Master's in Computer Engineering at New York University. Some of my courses were Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Centers & Cloud Computing and Network Security.

🚀 In my free time, I enjoy dancing, building personal projects, expanding my knowledge and experimenting with new tech.
